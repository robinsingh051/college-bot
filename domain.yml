        "AI and Machine Learning (ML) technology have become a major part of the armoury for many industries whether it be private companies, financial services, healthcare, or governments.
        These data-driven tools are used to make ever more important decisions that can have a far-reaching impact on individuals and societies."

  utter_q2:
    - text: "No. We have excellent faculty members and instructors with us who will make the course very easy to learn and understand. Anyone who wants to learn machine learning and make a career in it can easily learn AI and ML. As a subject, Machine Learning is a fusion of concepts from Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics."

  utter_q3:
    - text: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like humans. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning."

        "Yes. Almost everyone who has a computer, smartphone, or other smart device is already using AI to make life easier:
        1.	Siri and Cortana act as your personal assistants using voice processing
        2.	Facebook recommends photo tags using image recognition
        3.	Amazon recommends products using machine learning algorithms
        4.	Waze suggests optimal driving routes using a combination of predictive models, forecasting, and optimisation techniques"

  utter_q5:
    - text: "Machine learning is the core driver of AI. Itâ€™s the concept of having computers learn from data with minimal programming."

  utter_q6:
    - text: "Machine learning works with structured data to detect patterns that provide insight. Everyday examples are personalised recommendations from services like Amazon or Netflix. In the financial arena, machine learning predicts bad loans, finds risky applicants, and generates credit scores."

  utter_q7:
    - text: "The main difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence is that the former is a subset of the latter. To put it simply, AI encompasses all machine learning but not all artificial intelligence practices are associated with machine learning."

        "Step 1.	Set concrete goals or deadlines. Machine learning is a rich field that's expanding every year.
        Step 2.	Walk before you run.
        Step 3.	Alternate between practice and theory.
        Step 4.	Write a few algorithms from scratch.
        Step 5.	Seek different perspectives.
        Step 6.	Tie each algorithm to value.
        Step 7.	Don't believe the hype.
        Step 8.	Ignore the show-offs."

        "Step 1: Adjust Mindset. Believe you can practice and apply machine learning.
        Step 2: Pick a Process. Use a systemic process to work through problems.
        Step 3: Pick a Tool. Select a tool for your level and map it onto your process.
        Step 4: Practice on Datasets.
        Step 5: Build a Portfolio.
        If you're an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you're a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI."
